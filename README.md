# React Project - Resume

## Description
This is a React-based project that generates a professional resume with editable fields. It provides sections for personal information, skills, work experience, education, achievements, and more. The project allows users to customize their resume by editing fields and provides a visually appealing design with a circular profile picture and blue accents.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (npm is bundled with Node.js)
  
To check if Node.js and npm are installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-resume.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   Change to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd react-resume
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary libraries and packages listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Run the development server**

   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server and open the project in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the development server and opens the project in the browser.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.
- `npm test`: Runs tests for the app.
- `npm run eject`: Exposes the configuration files (not recommended unless you need to customize the setup).

## File Structure

- `public/`: Contains static files like the `index.html` file and assets like images.
- `src/`: Contains the React components and other application code.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components like `Profile`, `Experience`, `Education`, etc.
  - `App.js`: The main React component where the layout of the resume is defined.
  - `App.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.

## Project Structure

- `Profile Section`: Displays the profile picture with a blue border and personal information.
- `Skills Section`: Lists the skills with categories and editable fields.
- `Experience Section`: Lists work experience with editable fields for each entry.
- `Education Section`: Displays educational qualifications with editable fields.
- `Achievements Section`: Lists notable achievements.

> The images are located in the `public` folder. 

## Customization

To customize your resume:

- Modify the fields in `src/components/` to add or change the content.
- You can adjust styling in `App.css` for a more personalized design.
- If you want to add more sections or fields, follow the existing structure and add new components in the `components/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with dependencies or installation, try deleting the `node_modules/` folder and the `package-lock.json` file and running `npm install` again.
- If the application doesnâ€™t load properly, ensure that your `Node.js` version is up to date.
